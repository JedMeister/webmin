Webmin - Web based interface for system administration
======================================================

Source package notes
--------------------

There is a webmin debian package available upstream (maintained by Jamie
Cameron, main author of webmin) but unfortunately, or not - depending on
your preference, it includes all modules.

This source package creates a 'webmin' minimal package aswell as
webmin-<plugin> packages.

To streamline and minimize maintenance, the:
    - webmin package is created on-the-fly from webmin-minimal tarball
    - webmin module and theme packages are auto-generated from their
      relative folders
    - modules and themes are pre-generated using a helper script which
      uses the full tarball, aswell as creates seed control file
      information
